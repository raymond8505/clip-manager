# What?

Parse video clips for verbal commands with Speech To Text AI , then automatically create and manage clips based on those commands.

# Who?

Me, mostly

# Why?

Recording, clipping and publishing gaming replays is tedious and there's a lot that can be automated.
Also this seemed like a fun project.

# Install

Client is its own package that needs to be installed after installing the main package

# Usage

Record your gaming, when you do something you want to clip say "clip" into your mic. When the video is parsed a clip will be created starting 25s before "clip" and extending 5s after it. (It's hardcorded now, but will probably create a settings screen eventually)

1. Drag clips into `/media/video/unparsed`
2. click the clip in the Unparsed Videos panel to parse
3. Watch your clips!
